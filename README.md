## Refactor of the Horiseon Page

---

The client found a few issues with the webpage and, whilst getting those fixed wanted the backend code to be tidied up, and both documents made easier to navigate.

My motivation was to maintain consistency on the UI but try to re-work the back end to simplify it as much as possible. In addition to this I added comments throughout the HTML and CSS to provide easier navigation for myself and future developers.

The problems solved were:
* No project README 
* No page tab title
* No favicon
* Non-semantic elements in the HTML 
* A broken navigation link
* Lack of accessability alt= attributes on images/icons

I was able to practice the input of HTML semantic elements instead of a code relying on the div element. From this formatting I was then able to further my knowledge on how to format/consolidate HTML elements via the stylesheet.

## Installation

Will work on most browsers (if not all). 

No specific additional programs needed for it to run.

---

## Usage

To use the navigation simply hover your cursor over the spaced titles and click. You will then be taken to the relevant box. Refer to the screenshot below for what the navigation bar looks like:

The rest of the page is fairly simple without any further click events.
