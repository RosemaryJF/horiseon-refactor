# horiseon-refactor

## Refactor of the Horiseon Page

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

I was given the task of Refactoring the Horiseon Web Page.  The client had found a few issues with the webpage and whilst getting those fixed wanted both the HTML and Css code to be tidied up, the stylesheet consolidated and comments inserted throughout to make the documents easier to navigate in the future. 

My motivation was to maintain consistency on the UI but try to re-work the back end to simplify it as much as possible. 

The problems solved were a broken link, and the pages accessability. 

I was able to practice the input of HTML semantic elements instead of a code relying on <div>. From this I was able to I further my knowledge of how to format HTML elements via the stylesheet.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

I mainly used the following sites to ensure my index used suitable elements:

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML](mdn web docs HTML Guide)

I then used the following sites to template my README and learn how to format it:

[https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide](Professional README Guide)

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
