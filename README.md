## Refactor of the Horiseon Page

---

The client had found a few issues with the webpage and, whilst getting those fixed wanted both the HTML and Css code to be tidied up, and both documents made easier to navigate.

My motivation was to maintain consistency on the UI but try to re-work the back end to simplify it as much as possible. In addition to this I added comments throughout the HTML and Css to provide easier navigation for myself and future developers.

The problems solved were:
* No project README 
* No page tab title
* No favicon
* Non-semantic elements in the HTML 
* A broken navigation link
* Lack of alt= attributes on images/icons

I was able to practice the input of HTML semantic elements instead of a code relying on <div>. From this formatting I was then able to further my knowledge on how to format/consolidate HTML elements via the stylesheet.

## Credits

I mainly used the following sites to ensure my index used suitable elements:

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

I then used the following sites to template my README and learn how to format it:
